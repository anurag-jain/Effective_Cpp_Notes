#### Item 13: Use objects to manage resources.

1. So that you donâ€™t forget to release dynamically allocated memory and release resources like locks, file descriptors, sockets, db connection etc.

2. Idea is to put the heap allocated object inside a class and use the stack allocated object of this class to manage the encapsulated resource. Thus when the scope of managing object expires, its destructor will release the resource.

3. `std::auto_ptr`  and `std::shared_ptr` are general purpose smart pointers in standard library.

4. RAII - Resource Acquisition Is Initialization i.e. resources are acquired and immediatedly turned over to resource managing objects. Resource acquisition and initialization of resource managing object happens in same statement as below.

    `std::auto_ptr<SomeClass> pSmartPtr(new SomeClass());`

5. Resource managing object use its destructor to ensure resource are released. Make sure the destructor don't throw exceptions.

6. Because auto\_ptr deletes what it points to when it's destroyed; thus there can't be more than one auto\_ptr pointing to an object. You know what'd happen when one of them does delete. Thus auto\_ptr does ownership transfer upon copy or assignment; setting the old object to null.

7. Containers of auto\_ptr are not possible because the unusual copying behaviour of auto\_ptr will invalidate the copying behaviour of the container class.

8. Reference Counting smart pointer keep track of number of objects pointing to a particular resource and deletes the resource when nobody is pointing to it any longer.`std::shared_ptr` provides this facility. Doesn't support cyclic refenrece.

9. Containers of shared\_ptr are possible because of it copying nature. Thus better choice over auto\_ptr

10. `std::auto_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` use `delete` in their destructor not `delete[]`. Thus they can't  be used to manage dynamically allocated arrays. See `boost::scoped_array` and `boost::shared_array`.
